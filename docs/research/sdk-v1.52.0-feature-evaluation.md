# OpenHands SDK v1.52.0 feature evaluation (document-agent)

Scope: `openhands-sdk` and `openhands-tools` move from 1.51.0 to 1.52.0
(PyPI upload 2026-10-04). The complete upstream range `v1.51.0..v1.52.0`
(19 commits) was reviewed. No other component moved in this update.

Primary source: [OpenHands SDK v1.52.0 release](https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk/releases/tag/v1.52.0) and the [v1.51.0...v1.52.0 compare](https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk/compare/v1.51.0...v1.52.0).

## SDK 1.51.0 -> 1.52.0

| Upstream change | Decision | Evaluation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| #4630 fix: drop in-flight tool calls from `ask_agent` context | adopted implicitly | Sub-agent context fix inside the SDK. The doc plugin splits work via `task` (`TaskToolSet`) with a parent-written `context.md` (ADR-0001); the corrected context arrives with the pin. |
| #5363 fix(client): retry a lost create only where the server deduplicates; #5362 fix(server): dedupe concurrent conversation creates and forks | adopted implicitly | Client/agent-server robustness; this repository builds no agent-server image, so the fixes arrive only through the library pin. |
| #5462 feat: propagate automation observability context | not adopted | The plugin runs under a user/AgentCanvas session, not an OpenHands automation; no adoption surface. |
| #5485 fix(terminal): isolate tmux sockets to prevent cross-conversation handle reuse | adopted implicitly | Terminal-session isolation fix inside the SDK tools layer; lands with the pin. |
| #5209 fix(workspace): publish Docker ports on loopback | not adopted | Security hardening of SDK-managed remote workspaces; the doc plugin runs in the user workspace, not SDK-managed workspaces. |
| #5403 fix(agent-server): release terminal run permits promptly | not applicable | Agent-server change; this repository does not build or manage an agent-server image. |
| #5348 feat(agent-server): stop operation for a single BashCommand | available, not adopted | New server endpoint; the plugin does not call agent-server REST directly. |
| #5421 python-frontmatter 1.1.0 -> 1.3.0, #5420 uvicorn 0.52.4 -> 0.54.0, #5423 posthog 6.7.7 -> 7.60.0 | not applicable | Dependencies of `openhands-agent-server`, not of `openhands-sdk`/`openhands-tools`; they do not appear in this repo's lockfile. |
| #5426 typescript-eslint, #5424 prettier, #5427 @types/node, #5422 actions/checkout, #5472 TS agent-server version, #5494 example tmux socket paths, #5490 release | not applicable | TypeScript-client/CI/example housekeeping; this repo does not use the TS client. |
| fastmcp `>=3.2.0,<4`, pydantic `>=2.13.5`, pillow `>=12.3.0`, requires-python `>=3.12` unchanged | n/a | The SDK's constraint surface is identical to 1.51.0; `check_plugin_load.py` confirms `Plugin.load` and the tool registry still pass on 1.52.0. |

## Compatibility deferrals

MCP 2.x remains deferred transitively: installed SDK 1.52.0 metadata
still requires `fastmcp>=3.2.0,<4`, which caps `mcp<2` (latest 2.3.0).
This repository keeps no `mcp` deferral entry in
`scripts/dependency_update_deferrals.json` — the cap is transitive — and
the existing `uv` deferral is unchanged. The `openhands-agent-server`
image tag `1.52.0-python` is available upstream; no committed image lock
is edited by this bump.
